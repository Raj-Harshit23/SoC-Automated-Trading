Disclaimer: This is only a prediction, use it on your own risk.
You can tweak the strategy in the python file as you want. And backtest it in backtester.ipynb.
Run the final.py file(ofcourse install the required libraries), enter the ticker symbol you want to predict for, and get to know the prediction whether its stock price will increase tomorrow or not. :)
(Assuming the asset is tradable and atleast 2 years old)
